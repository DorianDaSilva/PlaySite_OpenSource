      <h2><b>Welcome to our Community!</b></h2>
      <p>
      The playswap project (“company”, “we”, “us”, “our”) is committed to protecting your data and right to privacy. We have written this Privacy Policy in the most straightforward way to let you know how we collect and use your data: what we use it for, and whom we may share it with. It applies to all information we collect through our website.<br/><br/>
      This document is important, so please read it carefully. It will help you make informed decisions regarding the personal data you share with us and your privacy. Please discontinue using our site and services if you find anything in it that you do not like or agree with. If you have any questions or need clarification, contact us at info@playswap.org.
      </p><br/><br/>
      <h3><b>1. When we collect your Personal Data?</b></h3>
      <br/>
      <p>
      When you interact with the playswap website (hereinafter referred to as ”the Services”), we collect only the following:<br/><br/>
      <b>Publicly-available blockchain data</b><br/>
      When you connect your blockchain wallet to the Services, we collect and log your publicly-available blockchain address to learn more about your use of the Services and to screen your wallet for any prior illicit activity. Note that blockchain addresses are publicly-available data that are not created or assigned by us or any central party and by themselves are not personally identifying.<br/>
      The legal basis for this is our legitimate interests, such as monitoring and improving the playswap Interface, the proper protection of the playswap Interface against risks and partly the contract performance basis to provide you with the Interface. Note that we are not responsible for your use of any of the blockchains and your data processed in the DeFi space.<br/><br/>
      Keep in mind that the use of our Service is based on public blockchains designed to record transactions on networks of computer systems permanently. Many blockchains are open to forensic analysis, which can lead to de-anonymization and unintentional disclosure of personal data, especially when blockchain data is combined with other data. Because blockchain is a decentralized and/or third-party network that is not controlled or managed by us, we cannot delete, change or modify Personal Data from such networks.<br/><br/>
      <b>Information from Local Storage and other tracking technologies</b><br/>
      Our third-party services providers and we may access and collect information from local Storage, mobile device ID, cookies, web beacons, and other similar technologies to provide and personalize the Services and features of the Services for you across sessions. For example, we may use this information to remember the tokens you import. We may also use this information to learn about your preferences, your use of the Services, and our interactions with you. Information we collect from these technologies may include things such as browser type, referring/exit pages, operating system, device or browser language, and other device information. We group and analyze these user journeys collectively, in the aggregate, to improve our product user experience.<br/><br/>
      <b>Information from other sources</b><br/>
      We may receive information about your wallet address or transactions made through the Services from our service providers to comply with our legal obligations and prevent using our Services in connection with fraudulent or other illicit activities.<br/><br/>
      </p>
      <br/>
      <h2><b>Correspondence</b></h2>
      <p>We will receive any communications and information you provide directly to us via customer support, social media, or other official channels or when you participate in the official playswap events. Suppose you participate in events where our merch is raffled. In that case, we will record the delivery information or identity documents you directly provide to us (for example, your name, email, zip code, country, city, residential address, phone number or ID documents), the responses you provide to us, and your interactions with the Services. <br/><br/>Remember, we will never ask you to share your private keys or seed phrase of your wallet. Keep this information confidential.</p>
